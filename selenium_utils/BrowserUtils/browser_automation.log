[2025-04-25 19:12:16,705] [INFO] [AI] Page Verification Result:
This looks like a real page. It contains typical page elements you would expect‚Äîlanguage selection (English & Spanish options), a phone number, and links such as Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. The presence of navigation and footer elements strongly suggests that this is a real webpage, likely an appointment booking or landing page rather than a login screen or browser/network error.
