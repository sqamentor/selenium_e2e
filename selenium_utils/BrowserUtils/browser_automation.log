[2025-04-28 10:34:01,695] [INFO] [AI] Page Verification Result:
This looks like a real page.

Explanation:
The content clearly shows an actual appointment-booking webpage seeking user information (first name, last name, email, phone number, zip code). There are additional cues like choosing a communication method and a button labeled "Send Me The Code", indicating a functional appointment or verification process. There are also clear references to privacy policies and terms of use, indicating common elements for a legitimate form or page.

Confidence Score: 9.5/10
