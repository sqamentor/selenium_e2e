[2025-04-26 14:34:13,050] [INFO] [AI] Page Verification Result:
Analysis:
The provided webpage snippet includes input fields for personal data (name, email, phone number, zip code, etc.) and text like "Book Appointment" and "Send Me The Code," which strongly indicates it is a real page designed for appointment booking or registration, rather than a login screen. It does not show any typical indicators of a browser or network error, such as broken resource links or error messages.

Confidence: 9.5/10  
Explanation: This looks like a legitimate data collection/appointment scheduling form‚Äînot a login form or an error page.
