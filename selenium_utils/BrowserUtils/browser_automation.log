[2025-04-25 13:57:36,412] [INFO] [AI] Page Verification Result:
This appears to be a real page rather than a login screen or an error page. The presence of user-friendly elements such as "Book Appointment," a phone number, language selection (English and Spanish), and typical footer links ("Privacy Policy," "Terms of Use") strongly suggests a legitimate landing or scheduling webpage.
